## Why only exam attempt

The SecOps Group, the certification authority were offering a scholarship for the CNSP exam attempt. 
I checked out the syllabus of the exam and found out that it was a theory based exam.
The topics covered were the following:

These are topics that I mostly was familiar with, so I went ahead and attempted the exam without any preparation.

## Exam attempt

The exam uses a proctoring software to check your microphone and camera for the duration of the exam.

The exam duration was 1 hour wwith 60 questions to be attempted.
With all questions being theory MCQs, this wasn't a very daunting task.

I managed to finish the exam in around 30 minutes.

## Parting thoughts

The original price for the certification is $100 USD. That is not really something I would pay for this exam.
