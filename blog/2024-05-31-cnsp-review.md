## How I got the exam voucher

The SecOps Group, the certification authority were offering a scholarship for the CNSP exam attempt. 
I checked out the syllabus of the exam and found out that it was a theory based exam.
The topics covered were the following:

These are topics that I mostly was familiar with, so I went ahead and attempted the exam without any preparation.

## Exam attempt

The exam uses a proctoring software to check your microphone and camera for the duration of the exam.

The exam duration was 1 hour with 60 questions to be attempted.
With all questions being theory MCQs, this wasn't a very daunting task.

I managed to finish the exam in around 30 minutes and pass with merit (75% or above).

## Parting thoughts

The original price for the certification is $100 USD. The certification covers a lot of topics, although since I only had the exam voucher, I cannot make any statement regarding the material.

As for the exam, I found the experience to be pretty smooth and it served as an opportunity to test my basics.
