I have decided to start a blog to write about things that interest me. 
The posts will be about security and technology for now, but might cover other topics in the future.

<!-- truncate -->

This is going to compliment my [Write-ups](https://kunalwalavalkarwrite-ups.vercel.app/) collection.
Topics covered will mostly include:

- Short guides
- Certification / Course reviews
- Conference experince (If I get the time to visit any)
- Some technology that I am interested in

Blog post of similar topics will be found under the same tag.
