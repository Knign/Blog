I have finished my eJPT certification in my second attempt (More on this).
As such I will be reviewing both of my attempts and providing some tips so that you do not need a second attempt.

## First attempt
I attempted the exam for the first time on 06th of April. I failed that attempt with a score of 65% (the passing score being 70%).

Even though I was confident that most of my answers were correct, I made a severe error in my approach.

Before atttemptin the exam I had read in a couple different reviews that one should treat the exam like ac actual pentest and not a CTF. Even INE makes you aware of this fact in their "Letter of Engagement".

However I did not understand what it meant at that time. So let me save you the trouble and tell you myself: 

#### You are supposed to perform all the steps you would perform in a real pentest. The reason being, that INE checks the logs created on the attacker machine to give you points. So even if you do not see a question pertaining to a certain phase in the "Pentesting methodology", you still must perform it.
