I recently passed the INE Certified Cloud Associate (ICCA) exam. In this post I will review the exam material and the exam.

<!-- truncate -->

I must preface that I am not an absolute beginner when it comes to Cloud technology, having some experience due to college.

## Course material

The course material is relatively short when compared to other certification. However that makes sense considering that ICCA is focused towards cloud beginners.

The course is around 16 hours long with 9 labs included. These labs are what made the course worth it in my opinion as you could test your hands on the top three vendors' (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud) dashboards. There are some terms and conditions that you have to accept which are well within reason.

The instructor [Tracey Wallace](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tracy-wallace-tec) explains cloud concepts well without overwhelming the listener with overly sophisticated terms.
