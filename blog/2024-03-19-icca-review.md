I recently passed the INE Certified Cloud Associate (ICCA) exam with a score of 95%. In this post I will review the exam material and the exam.

<!-- truncate -->

I must preface that I am not an absolute beginner when it comes to Cloud technology, having some experience due to college.

The course material and exam voucher cost $99 USD. I got both with the Fundamental's Annual plan

## Course material

The course material is relatively short when compared to other certifications. However that makes sense considering that ICCA is focused towards cloud beginners.

The course is around 16 hours long with 9 labs included. These labs are what made the course worth it in my opinion as you could test your hands on the top three vendors' (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud) dashboards. There are some terms and conditions that you have to accept which are well within reason.

The instructor [Tracey Wallace](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tracy-wallace-tec) explains cloud concepts well without overwhelming the listener with overly sophisticated terms.

I would suggest you to take extensive notes for the exam as there is a lot of information in the course.

## Exam

The exam duration is 1 hour 30 minnutes, which is quite short. INE offers timers that can be set to alert the user after a certain time interval.

As for the questions, there are 46 theory question divided into three domains:
- Cloud Concepts
- Cloud Services
- Cloud Security and Regulatory Compliance.

There are also 4 practical questions that are to be solved in the exam lab.

## Passing grades

For passing the required grade is 75% which is further divided as follows:

### Theory
#### Cloud Concepts
Required grade: 72%

#### Cloud Services
Required grade: 75%

### Cloud Security and Regulatory Compliance.
Required grade: 65%

### Practical
Required grade: 2 out of 4 questions

Overall, I would say that the exam is worth it.
